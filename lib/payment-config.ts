/**
 * Regis Marie College GCash payment details.
 *
 * Edit the three values below with your real information. They are shown
 * on the student "New Request" page so students know where to send payment.
 *
 * gcashQrValue: what the QR code encodes. GCash doesn't have a public
 * standard deep-link format, so the safest default is to encode the same
 * name + number as text — students can also just read it off and pay
 * manually in the GCash app. If your school has an official merchant QR
 * image (PNG/JPG) instead, skip the generated QR entirely: drop that image
 * in /public/gcash-qr.png and set USE_QR_IMAGE to true below.
